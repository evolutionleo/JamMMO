## Introduction
This is an online game made in GameMaker + NodeJS in just 3 days.

That means the code is messy af and probably has a lot of bugs

However, This project still might be learning for some people
and that's why I'm publishing it anyway

## How to set it up
- If you don't have Node installed - go to nodejs.org and do it
- Open Sever/ folder in VS Code or terminal
- Execute "node server.js"
- Open up the GM project, located in Client/ folder
- Set config in top-right to "DevMode" to run the debug build with 2 game instances
- Pretty much done! You can play around, change stuff and all that. Have fun!

P.s. if you don't own PixelatedPope's Palette Swap asset, you will have players and bullets be all the same color
You can buy it (it's literally just 2$) and import into the project or just leave it as it is, I've included dummy functions that
will prevent the game from crashing in case it doesn't have Retro Palette Swapper imported

## License
As someone wise said - fuck licenses, do whatever you want!
(But please don't try and break into my game's servers, it isn't helpful for anyone and I've really got a lot of other things to do)
